Report on Use of AI in Completing CSS

For this assignment, I made use of an AI tool (Claude AI) to generate the CSS code that I submitted. The following outlines how I used AI, why I chose to do so, and what I learned in the process.

1. How I used AI
I provided the AI with specific instructions about the style I wanted for my project, including colors, layout structure, and responsiveness. The AI then generated complete CSS code that matched those requirements. I copied this code into my project and made minor adjustments to fit my HTML structure.

2. Why I used AI

To save time writing out repetitive style rules.

To learn new CSS techniques and syntax by seeing how the AI approached the styling.

To experiment with different design ideas quickly, which would have been slower if I had written everything manually.

3. What I learned
Using the AI-generated CSS helped me understand:

How to structure styles for consistent theming across an entire page.

How media queries work for responsiveness.

How different color palettes and spacing values affect the visual feel of a site.

The importance of not relying blindly on AI output, since some rules needed manual tweaking to fit my specific HTML.

4. Reflection
AI was not a substitute for understanding CSS, but rather a tool that sped up the process and gave me examples to study. By analyzing the code it generated, I was able to reinforce my own knowledge and get more comfortable with CSS design principles.
